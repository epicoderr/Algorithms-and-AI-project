1. **What did I do this week**
- All the core implementation is done, added tests to make testing more comprehensive. Also tried a new weight matrix for the heuristic which seems to have improved performance from my testing. Took maybe 3-4 hours

2. **How has the program progressed?**
- Tests were added which made the coverage go from 85% to 95%

3. **What did I learn this week/today?**
- I learned more about implementing tests and what makes an effective heuristic

4. **What remains unclear or has been challenging?**
- Nothing I can especially think of

5. **What will I do next?**
- The core stuff is basically done, now its getting to 100% test coverage and working to improve the testing and implementation documentation for the final submission. Also any feedback I get will also be looked into.
