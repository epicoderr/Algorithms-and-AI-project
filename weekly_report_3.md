1. **What did I do this week**
- Continued working on the project in all areas, I should probably learn to track my time in the future since I am not sure but maybe 6 hours of work

2. **How has the program progressed?**
- Game logic is looking solid, expectiminimax is implemented and the user can actually play the game as well as have the AI play the game

3. **What did I learn this week/today?**
- I have my project structure down now and I pretty much what I will need to do to improve it from here

4. **What remains unclear or has been challenging?**
- Heuristic remains a placeholder so that will have to be done soon

5. **What will I do next?**
- Focus mostly on the heuristic since the other things are much further along, I also need to add more tests to check that everything actually works
