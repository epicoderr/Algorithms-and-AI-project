1. **What did I do this week**
- Started working on the project, got the structure somewhat in place, some progress in various areas, overall did not do that much work, considering the reading I did as well maybe 3-4 hours of work overall.

2. **How has the program progressed?**
- Basic structure components are there, its a starting point that hopefully I can work off of in future weeks.

3. **What did I learn this week/today?**
- I read through the article linked in the course page on this topic which was very helpful, outside of that I learned generally what kind of structure I want to have and how I should achieve it in the coming weeks.

4. **What remains unclear or has been challenging?**
- I definitely need to balance my time better as I am already falling behind, I should have plenty of time next week so I hope I can make solid progress.

5. **What will I do next?**
- My goal is to make a playable version by next week, if not that then at least I should have made significant progress of the expectiminimax and the heuristic.
