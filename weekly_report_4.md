1. **What did I do this week**
- Continued working on the project, mostly heuristic ajd testing, implementing a decent heuristic didnt take that long but tests took awhile to figure out, maybe 5 hours of work total.

2. **How has the program progressed?**
- There is a decent heuristic now, though it can still be much improved, and a good amount of tests have been added alongside testing documentation.

3. **What did I learn this week/today?**
- I learned more about implementing the heuristic as well as implementing the testing for the project.

4. **What remains unclear or has been challenging?**
- I havent done testing like this much before so I am unsure of what exactly I should be testing, right now I am just doing whatever comes to mind so it is not very organized or comprehensive.

5. **What will I do next?**
- I need to improve the heuristic and really focus on testing, also need to improve the code quality with pylint eventually.
