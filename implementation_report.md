The general structure of the program:
- board.py contains the game logic for 2048 and is thus responsible for initializing the grid, tracking the current score ect

- expectiminimax.py includes the expectiminimax search algorithm which tries to find the optimal move alongside the heuristic

- heuristic.py contains the heuristic evaluation function that is the base for the expectiminimax search

- main.py has a text based display where the user can play the game themselves as well as let the AI agent play it

Use of large language models (ChatGPT, etc.):
Used the LLM Gemini for assistance at various points. Code that was directly copied should be marked.
