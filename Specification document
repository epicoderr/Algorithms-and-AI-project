I am implementing an AI for the 2048 game
I will use python as the programming language. I am not familiar enoygh with others to confidently peer-review porjects written with them
For algorithms I will use expectiminimax as well as the heuristic evaluation function, for data structures probably a 2D array to represent the game board and trees
The program will take in the board state and random spawns as inputs and then try to evaluate the situation using expectiminimax
For the expected time and space complexoty from what I understood after reading the space complexity is just O(d) where d is the depth or number of player moves and time complexity is O(b^d n^d) 
where b is the number of possible moves and n is the number of possible random outcomes
As for sources I will at least probably use this one mentioned in the course material: https://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2016/report/NieHouAn-AIPlays2048-report.pdf 
If I use others I will be sure to mention them
